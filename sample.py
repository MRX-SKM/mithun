# Take input from the user
num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))

# Calculate the sum
sum = num1 + num2

# Display the result
print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {sum}")


How it works:
- User Input – It asks the user to enter two numbers.
- Addition – Adds the two numbers.
- Output – Prints the sum.
Run this in Python, and you’ll see the result instantly! Want me to add extra functionality? Let me know.
